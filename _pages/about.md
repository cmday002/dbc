## Our Product

We use modern building science and best practices to efficiently construct post frame buildings. We will work with you to design, engineer, and plan before any construction begins to achieve the best outcome for you and your property.


## Affordable solution for horses

A **12'x24' barn** is a great option for keeping one or two horses out of the weather. A 12' tall opening prevents injuries from rearing, and two vertical supports provide the option for three 8'x12' stalls.

## Consider a 9x18 for small livestock

Another simple animal solution is a **9'x18' shelter**. A single beam separates two 9'x9' sections making a great home for smaller livestock like donkeys, sheep, pigs or goats. These shelters can even be constructed without a fixed foundation, so you can drag them throughout your property for rotational grazing.

## Got anything smaller?

<br><br> Have a dog to keep dry? Pigs to rotate on a pasture? Chickens to protect? If you're looking for something small, this **9'x9' shelter** can be built in a day and moved with ease.
