When I was a kid a played with GI Joes.

Picking up where I left off in [my story]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/my-story): I began my jouney as an adult with full intention to become an Army officer - 3 of the 4 years I spent in college practically revolved around Army ROTC.

The military is our family business. Dad flew helos in the gulf, his dad served before him, and my two brothers served after.

Yep that's me - An ROTC cadet getting ready to hit the streets of Mogadishu - in reality this was a training event at Fort Riley, KS, probably on a Saturday or Sunday so it wouldn't interfere with our glamorous college lifestyle.

In all honesty I was fired up for this stuff (if that's not obvious). Like I said, as a kid playing Army in the ditch was the height of life. But this is where my path takes a major swerve. 

Like many nights before it, I decided to go out and celebrate a friend's birthday - I'm in college after all. There was one problem with this plan: I was on the hook to lead cadets in training at 5 AM the next morning. 

Well I'm a grown adult at this point and I know what I'm doing - so I went and had my fun. The next morning before the sun even thought about lighting the east I was in my car headed to my post. Pulled over for a minor speeding violation, the campus cop smelled my breath and rightfully took action. I made a big mistake that day and my life changed dramatically - my childhood dreams were crushed. 

But life goes on. The country was entering the tail-end of a 20-year war and I was on track to complete an engineering degree, so I decided to take my eager spirit elsewhere. It took years to recover mentally, but I learned a lot about myself during that time - and in retrospect I'll chalk that up as a gift.
