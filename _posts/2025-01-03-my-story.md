Welcome! 

My name is Chris, owner of DayBuildCo, and I'm writing this first post to share who I am.

I grew up in Manhattan, Kansas in the late 90's & early 2000's. I graduated from Manhattan High in 2010 and pursued an engineering degree from Kansas State.

## Career

College was both a challenge and a blast. I began my jouney as an adult with full intention to become an Army officer - 3 of the 4 years I spent in college practically revolved around Army ROTC - [more about that here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/my-childhood-dream). 

Among other activities I was a proud member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, (an on-campus fraternity), I tutored physics, met some amazing people, and I learned more than I ever could have imagined.

A degree in engineering doesn't typically come easy - everyone seemed to always be graded on a curve. 

Personally, the most valuable lessons came through the process of learning itself. 

Most of all I learned there are always going to be things to learn (even re-learn), and that isn't scary - it's a joy of life!

I completed my degree in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering in 2014 and moved to Denver to join a small team of telecom and oil & gas consultants. At this botique consulting firm I learned the value of data analytics and dove into data engineering.

In 2016 my then girlfriend and I decided to relocate closer to our families in Northeast Kansas. I took a job doing traditional engineering at YRC Freight and we moved to Overland Park, KS, where we got married in 2017. 

Traditional IE work makes a lot of sense to me: Measure inefficient processes and find ways to improve them - [just like Toyota](https://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Way-Management-Principles-Manufacturer/dp/0071392319). Climbing the ladder in corporate America, however, doesn't. So I jumped ship in 2018 and landed a job as a private consultant doing data engineering for large agricultural producers throughout the midwest - where I still work today.

## Hobbies

Music was a big part of my life growing up and I wanted to be a drummer for as long as I can remember. 

Eventually I got a drumset for Christmas; little did my parents know that would mean loud noise for the next 10 years. 

I linked up with some friends who shared the interest around age 13 and [we're still playing gigs in our 30's.](https://www.humbledpride.com/)

In 2019 we moved out of the city to the quaint town of Tonganoxie, KS. When COVID struck 6 months later, I wanted to try something new. Hunting was a great option because isolation was built right in! 

I spent many hours that first year out in the woods thinking about life, loved ones and what the future might hold. A year later, I harvested my first buck.

I still needed a physical activity. Thanks to [Jocko Willink](https://www.instagram.com/jockowillink/?hl=en) I took up Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

BJJ is ego-shattering. You know right away where you stand in the food chain when someone half your size puts you to sleep without breaking a sweat - it's great!

After a few years I was given a blue belt and somehow managed to stand on a few podiums in local tournaments.

Jiu Jitsu is still teaching me but one thing I've learned is on how long it can take become competent in a new skill. It takes some will to get on the mats day after day, knowing that you will lose, like, a lot. But if you trust the process, you will start to win - and it's worth it!

## Family

My wife and I had our first child in late 2021, and our second mid-2024. Having kids has been life changing in so many great ways, and I can't believe our first is almost ready for school!

That leads me to starting DayBuildCo. 

Here are a few truths I have always known about myself: 

1. I need a problem to solve. Nothing beats using your noggin. 
2. I need a physical project. Hard work feels great.

Additionally, in the last few years I have discovered something revelatory: 

> I love building things

The truth is - If I won the lottery today I would continue building.

So there you have it. That is why I started DayBuildCo.
