Welcome! 

My name is Chris, founder of DayBuildCo, and I'm writing this first post to share who I am.

I grew up in Manhattan, Kansas in the late 90's & early 2000's. I graduated from Manhattan High in 2010 and pursued an engineering degree from Kansas State.

College was both a challenge and a blast. I began my jouney as an adult with full intention to become an Army officer - 3 of the 4 years I spent in college practically revolved around Army ROTC - [more about that here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/my-childhood-dream). 

Among other activities I was a proud member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, (an on-campus fraternity), I tutored physics, met some amazing people, and I learned more than I ever could have imagined.

A degree in engineering doesn't typically come easy - everyone seemed to always be graded on a curve. 

Personally, the most valuable lessons came through the process of learning itself. 

Most of all I learned there are always going to be things to learn (even re-learn), and that isn't scary - it's a joy of life!

I completed my degree in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering in 2014 and moved to Denver to join a small team of telecom and oil & gas consultants.

It was there that I learned the value of data analytics. I dove deep into data engineering and opened my mind to a whole world of opportunity.

In 2016 my then girlfriend and I decided to relocate closer to our families in Northeast Kansas. I took a job doing traditional industrial engineering at YRC Freight and we moved to Overland Park, KS, where we got married in 2017. 

Traditional IE work makes a lot of sense to me: Measure inefficient processes and find ways to improve them - [just like Toyota](https://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Way-Management-Principles-Manufacturer/dp/0071392319). However, climbing the ladder in corporate America didn't feel quite right so I jumped ship in 2018 and landed a job as a private consultant doing data engineering work for large agricultural producers throughout the midwest - where I still work today.

In 2019 we moved out of the city to the perfectly quaint town of Tonganoxie, KS. When COVID struck 6 months later, I found myself eager to take up a new challenge. Hunting was a great option because isolation was built right in! 

I spent many hours that first year out in the woods thinking about life, loved ones and what the future might hold. A year later, I managed to harvest my first buck.

For some reason I still needed a physical struggle. With help from some notable influencers (ehem, thank you Jocko) took up the not-so-humble art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

Ironically, BJJ is the ego-shattering martial art of being put to sleep by someone half your size and I fell in love with it pretty much immediately. 

After a few years of ego destruction I was given a blue belt in 2024 and somehow managed to take the podium at a tournament in Colorado.


That leads me to starting DayBuildCo. 

Here are a few truths I have always known about myself: 

1. I need a problem to solve. Nothing beats using your noggin. 
2. I need a physical project. At the end of the day, hard work feels great.

Additionally, in the last few years I have discovered something revelatory: 

> I love building 

The truth is this: I would continue to build if I won the lottery; Money has nothing to do with it.

So there you have it. That is why I started DayBuildCo.
