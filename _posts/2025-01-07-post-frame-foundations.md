Choosing a foundation is a big decision that can impact your budget, project timelines, and structural longevity.

Post and pier foundations are a distinct advantage of post frame buildings. They use less concrete and can be installed quickly.

I'll outline some of the most common post frame foundation options and share why I install [Sturdi-Wall brackets from Midwest Perma-Column](https://www.midwestpermacolumn.com/product-category/concrete-anchor-brackets). 

## Pole Foundation

This is what the farmers call a pole barn. Dig a hole at frost depth, drop in a [concrete cookie](https://www.hansenpolebuildings.com/2014/03/concrete-cookies/) followed by a telephone pole notched at the top to set the trusses on, and backfill with soil. Uplift cleats or blocks can be added before backfill to keep the posts from lifting out of the ground from wind loads. Poles are usually planed to accept girts and wall framing.

## Post Foundation

Same idea here as a pole barn, except with engineered posts made from dimensional lumber. This simplifies the design process for an engineer and gives the builder a better platform to set trusses and frame the walls.

There are more options with these methods, like sleeves around the post to combat rot and backfilling with concrete for more shear and uplift strength.

## Poured Pier Foundation

Footings are still dug to frost line depths, but concrete is poured directly into the holes and brackets are wet-set before the concrete cures.

Digging footings and pouring a pier foundation is how I typically install post frame foundations. There are several reasons for this:

* Layout, prep and install can be done within a few days depending on building size.
* Wood to ground connection is eliminated, avoiding post rot.
* Walls can safely be framed on the ground and later raised reducing labor costs.

## Embedded Pier Foundation

Pre-cast concrete piers with brackets already installed can be used to set a building foundation in areas inaccessible to concrete trucks.

## Slab On Grade

A reinforced concrete slab can be poured on a compacted base over the soil surface. Brackets are used in this option to provide a structural connection between posts and the slab. The slab is generally thicker and more heavily reinforced under posts along the perimeter. This reinforced areas are called grade beams.

## Stem Wall

A foundation or stem wall is the most labor intensive option and is the closest alternative to a traditional stick-frame foundation. Foundation walls are formed and poured atop footings below frost depth to create a moisture-resistant and stable platform for interior framing in structures like residential dewllings, i.e. barndominiums.
